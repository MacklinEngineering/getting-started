## Admins @ DevRel Collective

As many of us know, like most things we do as DevRel professionals, running this group takes a community of people. If you’re interested in being a part of that community and have been actively involved in the DevRel Collective for at least 6 months, we’d love to have you on board! Here are the expectations that we have for the “Benevolent Dictators” (our tongue-in-cheek name for admins):

- *What is it:* A defined tier of admins who are responsible for the day-to-day health and success of the DRC; collectively: the Admin Team.
- *Length of time:* 6 month stint which can “renew” at the end of each period. 
- *Prerequisites:*
  - Has been actively involved in the DevRel Collective for at least 6 months.
  - Actively takes the initiative to move projects forward and be actively involved in conversations.
- *Responsibilities:*
  - Each admin is the lead for a specific function within the DRC:
    - Mentorship Program Creation & Maintenance
    - Salary Survey 
    - Tool Development & Maintenance (e.g. On-Call Bot)
    - Escalation Point for Applications (e.g. Responding to emails & making exec decisions re: applications)
       - Be the executive decision-maker / tie-breaker for any applications that need additional review beyond a second set of eyes.
       - Triage & reply to emails that come into the team@devrelcollective.fun inbox
  - Everyone rotates through “on call bot” on a weekly basis:
    - Handling of all access requests
    - Escalate as appropriate
    - Handle PR requests as appropriate
  - Be present and available for monthly meetings.
  - When an admin decides to step down, they’re responsible to find a replacement for that function -- whether through referral or re-opening the admin form.
- *Removal:*
  - Violation of any Code of Conduct, be it DRC or any other community or organisation (online or in-person), is grounds for immediate removal, no questions asked.
  - Inability to fulfill the responsibilities, as outlined above, over a three month period is grounds for removal.
